# SVD-Image-Compression

A simple example of using Singular Value Decomposition for image compression. The example below is compressed by 76% (from a (710, 946, 3) uint8 numpy array to 9 2D arrays using the float64 datatype).

Compression rate is controlled with the `compression_factor` global variable, determining the percentage of singular values to be used.

More compression would likely be achieved with minimal quality loss by forcing usage of lower-precision datatypes than the default float64.
